# ðŸ“š Week 2 â€“ Digital Egypt Pioneers (Ø±ÙˆÙ‘Ø§Ø¯ Ù…ØµØ± Ø§Ù„Ø±Ù‚Ù…ÙŠØ©)

During the **second week** of the Digital Egypt Pioneers program, we continued our journey into Dart programming and focused on essential programming concepts that build the logic of any application.

---

## âœ… What We Covered:

### ðŸ”¹ Conditional Statements
We learned how to use conditional logic to make decisions in our programs:
- `if` and `if-else`
- `else if` chains
- Nested conditions
- Ternary operator (`condition ? value1 : value2`)
- `switch` statements for multiple cases

### ðŸ”¹ Loops
We explored how to perform repetitive actions using:
- `for` loops  
- `while` loops  
- `do-while` loops  
- Nested loops  
- Using `break` and `continue` to control loop flow

### ðŸ”¹ Functions
We developed an understanding of how to organize code into reusable blocks:
- Defining functions with and without parameters
- Returning values from functions
- Arrow function syntax
- Difference between `void` and return-type functions

## ðŸ’¡ Practical Application

Throughout the week, we practiced these concepts through hands-on coding tasks, challenges, and mini-projects.  
By the end of the week, we were able to:
- Write conditions based on user input  
- Iterate over data using loops  
- Build custom functions to simplify and reuse logic

## âœ¨ Summary

This week was a major step toward mastering core programming principles. The skills we learned will help us build more complex applications in the coming weeks.
