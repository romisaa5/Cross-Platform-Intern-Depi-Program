# 👩‍💻 Week 3 – Digital Egypt Pioneers (روّاد مصر الرقمية)

During the **third week** of the Digital Egypt Pioneers program, we started diving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Dart  one of the most important pillars of modern software development.

## ✅ What We Covered:

### 🔹 Session 1 – Introduction to OOP
We were introduced to the basic building blocks of OOP:
- `class` and `object`
- Constructors:
  - Default constructor  
  - Named constructor
- `static` variables and methods
- The first OOP principle: **Encapsulation**
  - Using private variables (`_var`)
  - Creating getters and setters

---

### 🔹 Session 2 – Advanced OOP Principles
We continued learning the remaining principles of OOP and explored advanced concepts:
- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- `super` and `override`
- Use of **mixins** for code reuse and flexibility

---

## 🧩 Hands-on Practice

We applied what we learned through multiple Dart exercises, such as:
- Defining real-world models using classes  
- Creating and using constructors (default & named)  
- Using static members for shared data  
- Implementing encapsulation using getters/setters  
- Reusing code via mixins

---

## 🚀 Summary

This week marked a major step forward in our programming journey. We now understand how to structure code in a more scalable, reusable, and organized way using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
OOP will be a foundation for all our future projects, especially in frameworks like Flutter.
