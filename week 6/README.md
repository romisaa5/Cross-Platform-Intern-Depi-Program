# 📅 DEPI - Week 6 

## 🧠 What We Covered

## 📍 Session 1

In the **first session** of Week 6, we covered important topics that help us customize and enrich our Flutter apps:

---

## 🎨 App Theming with `MaterialApp`

We learned how to:
- Customize the **theme** of our Flutter app using the `theme` property inside `MaterialApp`.
- Change primary colors, fonts, and other global styles for a consistent UI.
- Apply themes across the entire app to avoid repetitive styling.

---

## 📦 Adding and Using Packages

We were introduced to how to:
- Add **external packages** using `pubspec.yaml`.
- Import and use packages inside our code.
- Configure and customize them based on our app's needs.

> Example: using a package for custom fonts, icons, or state management.

## 🧱 The `Stack` Widget

We explored the `Stack` widget, which allows us to:
- Place widgets **on top of each other**, like layers.
- Create overlapping UI (e.g., placing a button over an image).
- Use `Positioned` widget to control exact placement inside the Stack.

---

## 📝 Task

At the end of the session, we were given a **task** to implement everything we learned:
- Apply app theming  
- Use at least one external package  
- Build a layout using the `Stack` widget

✅ In my task, I used the [`flutter_rating_stars`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rating_stars) package to display a rating widget inside the UI.
