# Digital Pioneers â€“ Week 8 ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ First Session
In the first session, we explored the **utils folder** structure in our Flutter project and understood the purpose of each file:

- `app_colors.dart` â†’ project color palette.  
- `app_texts.dart` â†’ static texts used in the app.  
- `app_paths.dart` â†’ asset paths (images, icons, etc.).  
- `app_fonts.dart` â†’ font families and styles.  
- `app_sizes.dart` â†’ responsive sizes and spacing.  
- `app_consts.dart` â†’ project constants.  
- `app_validators.dart` â†’ input validation logic.  

We also learned how to **add and use custom fonts** in Flutter.

## ðŸ“Œ Second Session
In the second session, we worked on a **task** that included:  
- Creating a **Future function** with `Future.delayed`.  
- Using **then / catchError / whenComplete** to handle success and error cases.  
- Practicing **async/await** with `try & catch`.  
- Implementing a simple **Login simulation** that throws an exception if the email/password are incorrect.

âœ… By the end of Week 8, we practiced both **project structuring (utils & fonts)** and **asynchronous programming with Futures**.
